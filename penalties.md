By removing these penalties, we inadvertently revealed that hacker news users seem to be disproportionately interested in stories that have nothing to do with hacking and startups. Now such stories are are not necessarily off-topic. According to the [HN guidelines](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html), one the one hand, "anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity is on-topic", but on the other hand "if they'd cover it on TV news, it's probably off-topic." 

But the inconsistency between the types of stories that have high true upvote rates, and the types of stories that Hacker News exists for, initially created a great deal of cognitive dissonance for us, until we reasoned as follows: 


It is natural that, once a community has formed around some topic, they will come to want to discuss unrelated topics with that same community. In every large company Slack I have seen, there are channels where people share photos about pets. People have interests outside of the narrow focus of a community, but they will want to discuss those interests with the people in the communities they know and identify with. So I think it is natural that people will want to discuss political, popular culture, and other major news items with the HN community.

I think in the *short-term*, people gain the most value from discussing whatever topic interests them, but in the long term communities lose their value if they don't artificially focus the discussion.

I believe HN has arrived at a compromise that penalizes off-topic articles while still allowing them, so that the community remains focused on hacking and startups, but people also derive value from discussing other topics that truly interest them.

We are going to look into [inferring penalties and applying them](https://github.com/social-protocols/news/issues/47) on Quality News. But in the meantime, that's why you see more off-topic content here.
