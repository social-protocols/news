<h2 id="upvote-rate">Upvote Rate</h2>
<p>The <strong>upvoteRate</strong> quantifies how much more or less
likely users are to upvote this story compared to the average story. It
is calculated as the story's total upvotes divided by total
<strong>expected upvotes</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="expected-upvotes">Expected Upvotes</h2>
<p>The <strong>expected upvotes</strong> for a story is an estimate of
the number of upvotes the <strong>average story</strong> would have
received if it were shown at the same times at the same ranks.</p>
<h2 id="rank-delta">Rank Delta</h2>
<p>The <strong>rank delta</strong> is the difference between the story's
actual rank and it's <strong>raw rank</strong></p>
<h2 id="raw-rank">Raw Rank</h2>

according to the "raw" Hacker News ranking formula:</p>
<pre><code>upvotes^0.8 / (ageHours+2)^1.8</code></pre>
<p>The actual Hacker News ranking formula applies additional adjustments
to the ranking score based on a variety of factors: penalties for
flagged stories, bonuses for stories in the 2nd-chance queue, and other
factors which are not entirely known.</p>
